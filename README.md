Scraping is challenging because every example is different. As I do different scraping projects, I'll try to save examples in this repo.

## The list so far

- [Paginated tables](paginated-tables.qmd)
- [Texas Longhorns Soccer Stats](longhorn-soccer-stats.qmd)

## Other resources

- The [rvest](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/index.html) package documentation.
- Hadley Wickham's [web scraping tutorial](https://github.com/hadley/web-scraping). He presented this as a half-day session at NICAR24.
- My [Billboard Data](https://github.com/utdata/rwd-billboard-data) repo uses Github Actions and rvest to scrape on a schedule.
