## About the site

Scraping is challenging because every example is different. As I do different scraping projects, I'll try to save examples in this repo.

## The list so far

- [Baseball Reference batting](s-bbref-batting.qmd)
- [Paginated tables](s-paginated-tables.qmd)
- [Playbill Grosses](s-playbill-grosses.qmd)
- [Heisman votes](s-sref-cfb-heisman.qmd)
- [Death row data](s-tdch-deathrow.qmd)
- [UT Soccer stats](s-ut-soccer-stats.qmd)

## Resources

- The [rvest](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/index.html) package documentation.
- Hadley Wickham's [web scraping tutorial](https://github.com/hadley/web-scraping). He presented this as a half-day session at NICAR24.
- My [Billboard Data](https://github.com/utdata/rwd-billboard-data) repo uses Github Actions and rvest to scrape on a schedule.

## To do

Too many to list, but I do want to learn [polite](https://dmi3kno.github.io/polite/) and build in some wait time.
